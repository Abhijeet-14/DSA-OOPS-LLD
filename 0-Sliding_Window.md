# ChatGpt Q
Certainly! Here are 25 sliding window problems from LeetCode, each with a brief statement:

1. **Minimum Size Subarray Sum:**
   Find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray with a sum â‰¥ a given target.

2. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:**
   Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

3. **Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards:**
   There are several cards arranged in a row, and you will pick any number of cards from the beginning or the end.

4. **Fruit Into Baskets:**
   You have a row of trees; each tree produces a certain type of fruit. You are given an integer array fruits.

5. **Minimum Window Substring:**
   Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window in s that contains all the characters in t.

6. **Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters:**
   Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

7. **Find All Anagrams in a String:**
   Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

8. **Consecutive Numbers Sum:**
   Given a positive integer n, how many ways can we write it as a sum of consecutive positive integers?

9. **Max Consecutive Ones III:**
   Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

10. **Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K:**
    Return the length of the shortest, non-empty, contiguous subarray of A with sum at least K.

11. **Subarray Product Less Than K:**
    Given an array nums of positive integers, find the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements is less than k.

12. **Binary Subarrays With Sum:**
    In an array A of 0s and 1s, how many non-empty subarrays have sum S?

13. **Max Consecutive Ones II:**
    Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array if you can flip at most one 0.

14. **Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters:**
    Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.

15. **Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero:**
    You have an array nums of length n and an integer x representing the sum you want to get after removing the subarray.

16. **Longest Turbulent Subarray:**
    Given an integer array arr, return the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of arr.

17. **Get Equal Substrings Within Budget:**
    You are given two strings s and t of the same length, and an integer maxCost.

18. **Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree:**
    Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X, there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

19. **Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target:**
    Given a matrix and a target, return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to target.

20. **Minimum Size of Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted:**
    Given an integer array nums, return the minimum size of subarray that, if removed, makes array sorted.

21. **Longest Happy Prefix:**
    A string is called a happy prefix if is a non-empty prefix which is also a suffix (excluding itself).

22. **Shortest Way to Form String:**
    From any string, we can form a subsequence of that string by deleting some number of characters (possibly no deletions).

23. **Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence:**
    Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

24. **Jump Game VI:**
    You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.

25. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee:**
    You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.
