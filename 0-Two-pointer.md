# Two Pointer

# ChatGPT Code
Explanation:
    - Initialize Two Pointers: often at start and end of the array.

    - Move Pointers Towards Each Other or Apart: 
        towards each other (contracting the window)
        apart (expanding the window).
    
    - Check Condition and Optimize: 
        Check a certain condition at each step involving the elements pointed to by the two pointers. 
        Adjust pointers and update data structures accordingly. 
        Optimize the algorithm by avoiding redundant computations.

# Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
# Output: [0, 1] (nums[0] + nums[1] equals 9)

def two_sum(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]

        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)
