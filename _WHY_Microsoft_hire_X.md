# I once asked My Microsoft manager why they hired me.

- because I asked LOT of Questions during the interview

## Role
- "What are the key objectives for this position in the FIRST month, 3 months, and year?"
- "Could you tell me more about the reason behind this role being available?"

## Team
- "Does your team participate in team-building activities or events?"
- "How frequently does the team communicate and share updates on their projects?"

## Manager
- "How do you support the professional growth and development of your team members?"
- "Can you describe your managerial approach or leadership style?"

## Company
- "What initiatives does the company have in place to promote diversity and inclusion?"
-  "How often do employees collaborate with colleagues from different departments?"

## Interviewer
- "What motivated you to join this company?"
- "Do you participate in any company-sponsored activities or Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) outside of regular work?"
