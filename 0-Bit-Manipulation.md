Bit manipulation is a technique where individual bits are manipulated to perform various operations. In Python, you can use the bitwise operators to perform bit manipulation. Here are some common bitwise operators and operations:

Bitwise Operators in Python:
AND (&):

Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
python
Copy code
result = a & b
OR (|):

Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.
python
Copy code
result = a | b
XOR (^):

Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1.
python
Copy code
result = a ^ b
NOT (~):

Inverts the bits; 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0.
python
Copy code
result = ~a
Left Shift (<<):

Shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
python
Copy code
result = a << 1  # Left shift by 1 position
Right Shift (>>):

Shifts the bits to the right by a specified number of positions.
python
Copy code
result = a >> 1  # Right shift by 1 position
Bit Manipulation Examples:
Checking if a Bit is Set:
python
Copy code
def is_bit_set(num, position):
    return (num & (1 << position)) != 0

# Example usage:
num = 5  # Binary: 101
position_to_check = 2
print(is_bit_set(num, position_to_check))  # Output: True
Setting a Bit:
python
Copy code
def set_bit(num, position):
    return num | (1 << position)

# Example usage:
num = 5  # Binary: 101
position_to_set = 1
result = set_bit(num, position_to_set)
print(bin(result))  # Output: 0b111 (binary representation of 7)
Clearing a Bit:
python
Copy code
def clear_bit(num, position):
    return num & ~(1 << position)

# Example usage:
num = 7  # Binary: 111
position_to_clear = 1
result = clear_bit(num, position_to_clear)
print(bin(result))  # Output: 0b101 (binary representation of 5)
Toggling a Bit:
python
Copy code
def toggle_bit(num, position):
    return num ^ (1 << position)

# Example usage:
num = 5  # Binary: 101
position_to_toggle = 2
result = toggle_bit(num, position_to_toggle)
print(bin(result))  # Output: 0b001 (binary representation of 1)
These examples showcase basic bit manipulation operations using Python's bitwise operators. Bit manipulation is often used in scenarios where performance optimization is crucial or when dealing with low-level hardware operations.
