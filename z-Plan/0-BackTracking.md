# ChatGPT Code:

```
def backtrack(nums, path, result):
    # Base case: if the path has the same length as nums, we found a permutation
    if len(path) == len(nums):
        result.append(path[:])
        return

    # Explore all possible choices
    for num in nums:
        # Skip if the number is already in the current path
        if num in path:
            continue
        # Make a choice
        path.append(num)
        # Recur to explore further choices
        backtrack(nums, path, result)
        # Backtrack by undoing the choice
        path.pop()

def find_permutations(nums):
    result = []
    backtrack(nums, [], result)
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
permutations = find_permutations(nums)
print(permutations)
