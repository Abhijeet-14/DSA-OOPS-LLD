**Flipkart Machine Coding - 21st March**
1. missed on edge cases
2. exception could have been handled better
3. instead of just using python built-in exception handler
4. code could have been more extensible to increase the ease of adding any new type
5. separation of concern was not there, single class was handling most of the functionality
6. need to work more on object-oriented-design and make the code more extensible(Edited)
