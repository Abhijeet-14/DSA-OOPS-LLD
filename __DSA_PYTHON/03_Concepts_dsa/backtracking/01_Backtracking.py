"""
Explanation:
    - Choose: 
        Make a choice at the current step of the algorithm. 
        This choice could be one of several options depending on the problem.

    - Explore: 
        Explore the consequences of the current choice. 
        Recursively continue making choices until either a solution is found or a dead end is reached.

    - Backtrack: 
        If a dead end is reached, backtrack to the previous step and explore other choices.
        This involves undoing the current choice and trying a different one.
