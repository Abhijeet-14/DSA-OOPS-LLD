L - Liskov subsitiution
    definition - a class can be replaced by its sub-class in all
                particular usage scenarios.

                - e.g., 'class Bird' & 'class Sparrow'
                        Bird can Fly
                    - Sparrow extends Bird

                        and Ostrich Also fly... bcoz of parent.
                        but in Real Ostrich DOES NOT fly.

                - so, 'GrandParent' class Bird & 'Parent' class FlyingBird

I - Interface segregation
    definition - it says, a client should not be FORCED to implement
                    an interface that it DOES NOT required.

                - means breaking interface into small small interfaces.
                    so purpose can be achieved

                - Example
                    'Worker' Interface(work() & sleep())
                        so..
                    if 'Human' implements Worker
                        then Human(work() & sleep())
                    also,
                    if 'Robot' implements Worker
                        then Robot(work() & sleep())
                    But that is NOT possible in REAL.

                - So, sub-interface needs to create.
                - 'Worker' interface &
                - 'Sleeping' interface
                - so,
                    Human -> Worker & Sleeping
                        Human(work() & sleep())
