# ARP:
- finds Physical Address(MAC) of IP
    - sender send REQUEST to all Network
    - each receive --> target respond
    - target send ARP back to Sender

# API Gateway
- single ENTRY/EXIT point for all API

# SSL/TLS
- SSL - Secure Security layer
- TLS - Transport Layer security

# Proxy & Reverse Proxy
- Proxy: middleman bw Client & Server. Send request to Server on behalf of client
- Reverse Proxy: sit infront of server -- forward client request to server. -- give Security

# Virtual IP
- it purpose to provide IP, which can used in network communication

# Caching
- temporary Storage of data

# Containerzation vs Virtualization
- both create Virtual Package
    1. VM 
        - copy of hardware of physical computer with complete OS
        - like running "mulitple Computer" with multi OS
    2. Container:
        - shares Kernel of Host OS with container
        - shared OS is Read Only
        - light weight

# Latency vs ThroughPUT
- Latency - time taken for packet travel
- throughPut - quanity of data send/receive in UNIT time.


# VPC
- public cloud - offers as - private cloud for limited IP
- e.x, ip range - 10.2.0.0/16 --> means --> 10.2.0.0 - 10.2.255.255
- subnet? - range of IP
